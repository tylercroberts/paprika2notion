# Setup
Run `pip install paprika2notion`

# Usage

This library is intended to make it easy for you to load recipes you have stored in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) into your Notion Workspace.

V0 of this library will assume you have downloaded and extracted your recipes to some path that we will refer to as: `/path/to/recipe/yaml.yaml`

For help doing this, check out: [paprika-recipes](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/paprika-recipes)


Once you have downloaded these, it is as straightforward as:
